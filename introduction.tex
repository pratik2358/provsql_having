\section{Introduction}
Nested aggregations are an important feature to
have in a practical system. Basic support of nested aggregation
is already implemented in ProvSQL. However, there is an
important semantics issue: the approach presented in the
literature for supporting nested aggregation, which adds a
comparison operator, makes sense for some specific provenance
frameworks (such as Boolean provenance), but there is no
clear semantics of how these comparison operators should
be implemented for arbitrary m-semirings.
