The semiring framework and its extensions are at the basis of a rich collection of theoretical
results and implementations for provenance tracking of database queries.
Many real-world queries use aggregation and conditions on the aggregate
values.
Support for such queries has been proposed by introducing semimodule
elements as aggregate values and formal comparisons between aggregate values as tuple
annotations, which is outside the semiring framework. In this work, we
show how to introduce a semantics for the provenance of such queries in
arbitrary semirings with monus, without the need for additional
operators. This semantics is shown to be compatible with the natural
join-based semantics of \textsf{HAVING COUNT(*)} queries, as long as the
semiring satisfies idempotence and distributivity of times over monus. We
derive algorithms for this semantics and show that they can be
implemented within the ProvSQL provenance tracking system with viable
performance on a real-world dataset for probabilistic query evaluation.
